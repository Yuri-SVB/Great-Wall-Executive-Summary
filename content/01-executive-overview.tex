\section*{Executive Overview}
This document presents a comprehensive valuation model for a Bitcoin security company operating an anonymous computation marketplace. The company (Mark) connects computation providers (Patrick) with clients (Charlie) through three revenue streams: platform fees from recurring computation services, one-time hardware sales for self-sovereign users, and branded merchandise that enhances brand loyalty and offsets customer acquisition costs. 

The financial model employs an innovative platform fee structure of \num{\markPlatformFeePercent}\%, comprising \num{\markBasePlatformFeePercent}\% for core platform operations (anonymous matchmaking, reputation system, dispute resolution) plus \num{\virtualMarketingBudget}\% as a virtual marketing budget that recognizes providers' role in customer acquisition. Academic research\cite{eisenmann2006} and industry benchmarks\cite{andreessen2020,bvp2023} demonstrate that supply-side participants in two-sided marketplaces effectively function as growth engines, with \num{15}--\num{30}\% of their revenue representing marketing value. By transparently accounting for this economic reality, the model shows how provider incentives align with platform growth while maintaining sustainable unit economics.

The model requires two funding rounds: a \$\numint{\seedAmount} seed round for marketplace platform development, followed by a \$\numint{\seriesAAmount} Series A for hardware development. With strategic partnership enabling market consolidation, the model targets \num{\targetShareSubs}\% of the subscription SAM (comparable to Coinbase, Stripe, LastPass penetration rates) and \num{\targetShareHw}\% of hardware SAM (aligned with YubiKey, Ledger market shares), projecting a path to \$\num{\targetValLow}--\num{\targetValHigh}M valuation by Year \num{3}.
