\section*{Executive Overview}
This document presents a comprehensive valuation model for a Bitcoin security company operating an anonymous computation marketplace. The company (Mark) connects computation providers (Patrick) with clients (Charlie) through three revenue streams: platform fees from recurring computation services, one-time hardware sales for self-sovereign users, and branded merchandise that enhances brand loyalty and offsets customer acquisition costs. The financial model employs an effective platform fee of \num{\markPlatformFeePercent}\%, consisting of \num{\markBasePlatformFeePercent}\% actual platform operations plus an estimated \num{\virtualMarketingBudget}\% virtual marketing budget. This accounting approach recognizes that providers function as growth engines for the marketplaceâ€”academic research\cite{eisenmann2006} and industry benchmarks\cite{andreessen2020,bvp2023} show that 15-30\% of provider revenue effectively represents marketing investment as they actively recruit clients to increase their earnings.

The model requires two funding rounds: a \$\numint{\seedAmount} seed round for marketplace platform development, followed by a \$\numint{\seriesAAmount} Series A for hardware development, projecting a path to \$\num{\targetValLow}--\num{\targetValHigh}M valuation by Year 3.
