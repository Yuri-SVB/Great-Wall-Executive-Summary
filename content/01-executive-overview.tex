\section*{Executive Overview}
This document presents a comprehensive valuation model for a Bitcoin security company operating an anonymous computation marketplace. The company (Mark) connects computation providers (Patrick) with clients (Charlie) through three revenue streams: platform fees from recurring computation services (\num{\markPlatformFeePercent}\% take rate), one-time hardware sales for self-sovereign users, and branded merchandise that enhances brand loyalty and offsets customer acquisition costs. The model requires two funding rounds: a \$\numint{\seedAmount} seed round for marketplace platform development, followed by a \$\numint{\seriesAAmount} Series A for hardware development, projecting a path to \$\num{\targetValLow}--\num{\targetValHigh}M valuation by Year 3.
