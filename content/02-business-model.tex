\section{Business Model: Two Revenue Streams + CAC Optimization}

\subsection{Revenue Stream Segmentation}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Subscriptions:} Anonymous marketplace for recurring memory-intensive computation services
  \item \textbf{Hardware:} One-time purchase for technical users wanting self-sovereign security tools
  \item \textbf{Merchandise (CAC Offset):} Branded items (t-shirts, caps, mugs) sold at profitable margins to reduce customer acquisition costs
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Subscription Service: Anonymous Computation Marketplace}
The subscription service operates as a computation matchmaking marketplace connecting:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Charlie (Clients):} Users needing recurring memory-intensive computation without owning adequate hardware - anonymity critical for privacy
  \item \textbf{Patrick (Providers):} PC owners monetizing idle computational capacity - can operate publicly to attract clients
  \item \textbf{Mark (Marketplace):} Platform providing anonymous client matching, reputation system, and dispute arbitration
\end{itemize}

Key marketplace dynamics:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Computation jobs are simple but memory-intensive, recurring weekly
  \item Anonymity is critical for Charlie, while Patrick can promote services openly
  \item Provider incentives drive viral growth as they recruit clients to increase revenue\cite{parker2016}
  \item First-mover advantage critical to build reputable user base before competitors
  \item Tiers differentiate by computation duration: \numint{\computeHoursBasic}, \numint{\computeHoursMedium}, \numint{\computeHoursProfessional}, \numint{\computeHoursGolden}, and \numint{\computeHoursPlatinum} hours
\end{itemize}
