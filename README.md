## DISCLAIMER 

This document is being developed with assistance of generative AI tools and is currently a **draft**. Unless explicitly otherwise stated, assume information contained therein **not** to accurately reflect author's opinion.

## CRITICAL ISSUES TO RESOLVE

### Numerical Corrections Required
- **Fix 4,032% CAC reduction claim** - actual reduction is 40.3% ($8.06/$20)
- **Reconcile ARR vs actual revenue** - Section 4.6 incorrectly shows them as identical when Section 4.1 shows ~54% difference
- **Address unrealistic LTV:CAC ratio** of 183:1 (industry norm: 3-5:1)
- **Clarify valuation discrepancy** - Year 3 shows both $17.4M (base case) and $35-60M (exit scenario)

### Structural Issues
- **Fix Series A down round** - Currently shows $5.5M seed â†’ $3.7M Series A (major red flag)
- **Standardize revenue stream count** - Either "two streams + CAC optimization" or "three streams" throughout
- **Align financial projections** across all tables and sections

### Assumption Validation Needed
- **Merchandise attach rates** (60-65%) need justification vs industry norm (5-15%)
- **95% gross margin** for subscriptions requires support
- **5% annual churn** needs benchmarking data
- **"Virtual marketing budget"** concept (20% of fees) may be seen as financial engineering

### Market Analysis Revision
- **Segment TAM properly** - Currently conflates password managers, private security, and physical vaults
- **Justify market share targets** (15% subscriptions, 10% hardware) with clearer comparables
- **Remove or substantiate** adjacent market inclusions

### Next Development Steps
1. Implement value validation checks in `/values/` directory files
2. Add source citations for all market assumptions
3. Create sensitivity analysis showing base/target/optimistic scenarios
4. Document all calculation methodologies explicitly
5. Reconcile all cross-referenced values between sections
6. Consider third-party review of financial model

**Status**: Pre-revenue financial model requiring substantial revision before investor presentation.
