% viral.tex - Viral marketing coefficients and network effects

%% ================= Viral Marketing Fundamentals =================
% Provider referral coefficient (providers incentivized to bring clients)
% Higher coefficient since providers aren't anonymous and can publicly promote
% Based on Airbnb host referral data (HBS 2016): 0.2-0.3 range
\newcommand{\providerViralCoeff}{0.25}

% Annual viral growth factor (compounds as network grows)
% Conservative based on NFX (2018) marketplace research
\newcommand{\viralGrowthFactor}{1.10}

%% ================= Viral Customer Growth Multipliers =================
% Viral multiplier per year (1 + viral coefficient × existing base × adoption rate)
% Year 1: Limited viral effect as network builds
\newcommand{\viralMultiplierYearOne}{\fpeval{1 + \providerViralCoeff * 0.2}}

% Year 2: Growing viral effect with proven providers
\newcommand{\viralMultiplierYearTwo}{\fpeval{1 + \providerViralCoeff * 0.5}}

% Year 3: Strong viral effect with established network
\newcommand{\viralMultiplierYearThree}{\fpeval{1 + \providerViralCoeff * 0.8}}

%% ================= CAC Reduction from Viral Effects =================
% CAC reduction from viral effects by year (%)
% Based on CB Insights (2021) marketplace platform studies
% Conservative estimates aligned with Kumar et al. (2007) WoM research
\newcommand{\cacViralReductionYearOne}{8}
\newcommand{\cacViralReductionYearTwo}{18}
\newcommand{\cacViralReductionYearThree}{30}

%% ================= Effective CAC with Viral Effects =================
% Effective CAC after viral reduction
\newcommand{\effectiveCACYearOne}{\fpeval{\cacDigital * (1 - \cacViralReductionYearOne/100)}}
\newcommand{\effectiveCACYearTwo}{\fpeval{\cacDigital * (1 - \cacViralReductionYearTwo/100)}}
\newcommand{\effectiveCACYearThree}{\fpeval{\cacDigital * (1 - \cacViralReductionYearThree/100)}}
